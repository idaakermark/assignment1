        <h3>Candles By Ida</h3>
        <p>
            During the pandemic I started makeing my own scented candles from home.
            I love having scented candles in my home, but i also want them to match 
            every season. Therefore, i started making candles for winter, spring, summer, 
            and fall. My candles are made from 100% soy wax and the fragrance oils are 
            ofcourse non-toxic. The wood-wick gives off a crackling sound, kind of like 
            a fireplace in a smaller format. I also chose to work with the wood-wick because 
            it extends the burning time. If you like the smell of freshly baked Gingerbread
            cookies, toasted marshmallow fireside or mulled wine, don't hesitate to try one 
            of the christmas collection candles!

        <h3>Why choose a soy wax candle?</h3>
        <p>
            Soy Wax is non-toxic and cleaner-burning being made with no toxins, carcinogens, 
            or pollutants which means my candles are less likely to trigger allergies.  As a 
            vegetable-based wax, it does not give off any harmful byproducts or produces black 
            soot that can stain walls and curtains like the other leading waxes.
            Soy Wax is Natural, Renewable and Vegan derived from the soybean. This wax is a 
            hydrogenated vegetable oil that turns to a solid at room temperature. You can even 
            make your own soy wax from soybeans at home.
